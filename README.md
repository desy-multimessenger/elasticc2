We now use this for the first stage of classification for the ELAsTiCC challenge.

Useful links:
- [ELAsTiCC documentation](https://portal.nersc.gov/cfs/lsst/DESC_TD_PUBLIC/ELASTICC/)
- [Data](https://syncandshare.desy.de/index.php/s/LLzErE9QgLpNFLZ)

Main question:
- How to set up the tree? Recurrent vs non recurrent or galactic vs non-galactic?
- Are there better approaches?
